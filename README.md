# [Tending Takes Time]()

Why should it take the same amount of time for a doctor to fix a surface cut on an arm as it takes to stop the bleeding of a recently shot off leg?

With this mod active the time it takes to tend to an injury will vary based on some different factors.

Things that increased tend-time:


- Heavy bleeding, with massive bleeding increasing it even more
- Life threatening injury
- Internal injury
- Missing bodypart



Things that decrease tend-time:


- Low bleeding with no bleeding decreasing it even more
- Permanent injury
- External injury



All factors can be turned off in the mod settings as well as changing the decrease and increase-values.

Technically the mod adds an init-action to the waiting-toil of the tending-job that changes the duration based on the hediffs that will be tended.
