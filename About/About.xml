Why should it take the same amount of time for a doctor to fix a surface cut on an arm as it takes to stop the bleeding of a recently shot off leg?

With this mod active the time it takes to tend to an injury will vary based on some different factors.

Things that increased tend-time:
[list]
[*]Heavy bleeding, with massive bleeding increasing it even more
[*]Life threatening injury
[*]Internal injury
[*]Missing bodypart
[/list]

Things that decrease tend-time:
[list]
[*]Low bleeding with no bleeding decreasing it even more
[*]Permanent injury
[*]External injury
[/list]

All factors can be turned off in the mod settings as well as changing the decrease and increase-values.

Technically the mod adds an init-action to the waiting-toil of the tending-job that changes the duration based on the hediffs that will be tended.
